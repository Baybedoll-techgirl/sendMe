<p align="center">Capstone project using React for the front end and express, and mongoDB for the backend. This project uses CRUD operations to create, update, and remove events. 
The sign up/login routes use local storage in the browser to store session data. I choose to use this as 'authentication' until the app matures and then plan on using an OAuth provider for full authentiction. </p>
